# Running Visualization

Personal running footprint viewer inspired by dense GPS point-cloud maps. It parses Garmin export data, keeps only running GPS tracks from May 2022 onward, privacy-trims activity starts/finishes, and renders the points in a local WebGL browser view.

## Run

Rebuild the generated data:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_visualization_data.py
```

Serve the viewer:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 -d public
```
